## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ **or** Docker + Docker Compose
- A Telegram account

---

## Step 1 — Create your Telegram bot

### 1.1 Talk to BotFather

BotFather is the official Telegram bot that lets you create and manage bots.

1. Open Telegram (desktop or mobile)
2. In the search bar, search for **@BotFather** and open the chat
3. Send the command `/newbot`

BotFather will ask you two things:

- **Name** — the display name of your bot, shown in chats (e.g. `My Book Bot`)
- **Username** — must be unique and end with `bot` (e.g. `my_book_bot`)

Once done, BotFather replies with a message containing your **bot token**, which looks like this:

```
123456789:AAFxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Copy it — you'll need it in the `.env` file.

### 1.2 Find your Telegram user ID

The bot uses a whitelist to restrict who can use it. You need to add your own numeric Telegram ID.

1. In Telegram, search for **@userinfobot** and open the chat
2. Send any message (e.g. `/start`)
3. It replies with your info, including your **Id** (a number like `123456789`)

Copy that number — it goes in `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` in the `.env`.

If you want to allow other people, ask them to do the same and give you their ID. You can add multiple IDs separated by commas.

---

## Step 2 — Download the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zoeille/maman-books.git
cd maman-books
```

Or download and extract the ZIP from GitHub if you don't have git installed.

---

## Step 3 — Configure the environment

Copy the example config file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then open `.env` in any text editor and fill in the values:

```env
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=123456789:AAFxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
ALLOWED_USER_IDS=123456789
ANNA_ARCHIVE_URL=
```

**Required variables:**

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` | The token you got from BotFather in Step 1.1 |
| `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` | Your Telegram user ID from Step 1.2. Multiple IDs: `111,222,333` |

**Optional — Anna's Archive:**

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `ANNA_ARCHIVE_URL` | Base URL of the Anna's Archive instance to use. Leave empty to disable. |

**Optional — Prowlarr integration** (for torrent support and additional indexers):

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `PROWLARR_URL` | URL of your Prowlarr instance, e.g. `http://localhost:9696`. Leave empty to disable. |
| `PROWLARR_API_KEY` | Found in Prowlarr under Settings → General → API Key |
| `BOOKS_DOWNLOAD_PATH` | The folder where your torrent client saves completed downloads |
| `DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT_MINUTES` | How long to wait for a torrent to finish (default: `15`) |

Both sources are optional and independent — you can enable one, the other, or both. At least one must be configured for the bot to return results.

**Optional — Format & conversion:**

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `ALLOWED_FORMATS` | Comma-separated list of formats to offer. Accepted values: `epub`, `pdf`, `mobi`, `azw3`. Default: `epub,pdf`. If only one value is set, no format question is asked. Kindle models from 2022 onward support EPUB natively — MOBI/AZW3 are mainly needed for older Kindles. |

Format selection only applies to epub results. The bot always downloads EPUB and converts on the fly:
- **→ PDF**: PyMuPDF (no extra dependency required)
- **→ MOBI / AZW3**: Calibre's `ebook-convert` if installed, otherwise PyMuPDF as fallback

**Optional — Calibre (for accurate MOBI/AZW3 conversion):**

Install [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com) on the machine running the bot. No configuration needed — the bot auto-detects `ebook-convert` in your PATH. Without Calibre, MOBI/AZW3 conversion falls back to PyMuPDF (output may vary).

The startup log shows whether Calibre was found:
```
  Calibre        : ✓ ebook-convert trouvé
```

**Optional — Email & Send to Kindle:**

The bot can send books directly to an email address or to a Kindle. Each user stores their own email/Kindle address via `/settings`.

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `SMTP_HOST` | SMTP server hostname. Default: `smtp.gmail.com` |
| `SMTP_PORT` | SMTP port. Default: `587` (STARTTLS) |
| `SMTP_USER` | SMTP login (e.g. your Gmail address) |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD` | SMTP password. For Gmail, generate an **App Password** at [myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) (do not use your regular password) |
| `SMTP_FROM` | Sender address. Defaults to `SMTP_USER` if left empty |

> **Send to Kindle:** add the `SMTP_FROM` address to your Amazon account's "Approved Personal Document E-mail List" (Amazon account → Manage Your Content and Devices → Preferences → Personal Document Settings).

SMTP is global (set once in `.env`). Each user sets their own destination address with `/settings`.

**Optional — VirusTotal** (scans downloaded files before sending):

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY` | Your VirusTotal API key. Leave empty to disable. Free tier supports up to 4 requests/min. Files larger than 32 MB are skipped. |

To get a free API key:
1. Create an account at [virustotal.com](https://www.virustotal.com)
2. Go to your profile (top-right) → **API key**
3. Copy the key and paste it as `VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY` in your `.env`

The free tier is sufficient for personal use. The bot checks by file hash first — if VirusTotal already knows the file, no upload is needed and the result is near-instant.

**Optional — Update notifications:**

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `GITHUB_REPO` | GitHub repository to watch for new releases, in `owner/repo` format. Defaults to `Zoeille/maman-books`. Set to empty to disable. |

**Optional — Local Bot API server** (only needed if you want to send files larger than 50 MB):

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `LOCAL_API_SERVER` | URL of the local Bot API server (see below) |
| `LOCAL_API_ID` | API ID from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org) |
| `LOCAL_API_HASH` | API Hash from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org) |

By default Telegram limits file uploads to 50 MB. If you need more, see the Docker section below.

---

## Step 4a — Run directly with Python

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the bot
python bot.py
```

The bot will start and print its active configuration, then log `Bot started.` when ready:

```
--- maman-books v1.2.1 ---
  Anna's Archive : ✓ https://…
  Prowlarr       : ✗ désactivé
  Formats        : epub, pdf, mobi, azw3
  VirusTotal     : ✓ activé
  Calibre        : ✓ ebook-convert trouvé
  Email / Kindle : ✓ activé
  Mises à jour   : ✓ Zoeille/maman-books
  Limite fichier : 50 MB
  Utilisateurs   : 1 autorisé(s)
Bot started.
```

Open Telegram, find your bot by its username, and send `/start`.

To keep it running in the background on Linux/macOS:

```bash
nohup python bot.py &
```

---

## Step 4b — Run with Docker

Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.

A pre-built image is available at **`ghcr.io/zoeille/maman-books:latest`** — no need to build locally.

### Without local Bot API (50 MB file limit)

Edit `docker-compose.yml` and remove the `depends_on` block and the `telegram-bot-api` service — they are only needed for the local API server.

Then run:

```bash
docker compose up -d bot
```

Check the logs to confirm it's running:

```bash
docker compose logs -f bot
```

### With local Bot API server (no file size limit)

This requires registering your app on Telegram's developer platform:

1. Go to [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org) and log in with your Telegram account
2. Click **API development tools**
3. Fill in the form (App title and Short name can be anything)
4. You'll get an **App api_id** and **App api_hash**

Add them to your `.env`:

```env
LOCAL_API_SERVER=http://telegram-bot-api:8081
LOCAL_API_ID=12345678
LOCAL_API_HASH=abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890
```

Then start everything:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f bot
```

> **User preferences** are stored in `./data/user_prefs.json` on the host (bind-mounted into the container). The `data/` folder is created automatically on first run.

---

## Usage

1. Open Telegram and find your bot by its username
2. Send `/start` — on first launch, a setup wizard guides you through your preferences (default format, email, Kindle address)
3. Type any book title and send it
4. The bot searches and shows a list of results — tap one to download
5. If `ALLOWED_FORMATS` has multiple values, you'll be asked which format you want
6. If you've configured an email or Kindle address, you'll be asked where to send it (Telegram / Email / Kindle)
7. The file is sent — if VirusTotal is enabled, it's scanned first

Use `/settings` at any time to update your preferences (format, email, Kindle address).

## Troubleshooting

- **"All download sources unavailable"** — your ISP's DNS may be blocking download servers (Libgen, etc.). Switch to a public DNS such as Cloudflare (`1.1.1.1`) or Google (`8.8.8.8`). When running in Docker, you can set this in `docker-compose.yml`:
  ```yaml
  services:
    bot:
      dns:
        - 1.1.1.1
        - 8.8.8.8
  ```
